<h3>What do I need to use this?</h3>

All prerequisits will be shown in the First message sent by the script. Most times, you will need a fully qualified domain name, and an SSL certificate to go with it! 

These scripts are currently only supported on Ubuntu. Feel free to try them on Debian, or any other Linux OS, though I give no garuntee that it will work!

SSL can be obtained for free here:
